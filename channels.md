# HRMP channels

Channels are needed for parachains to communicate between each other. 

For example if Basilisk wants to send a message to Karura, a channel between them has to be opened. 

Hrmp channel is uni-directional, that means if Karura wanted to send a message back to Basilisk, another channel would have to be created for this purpose.

In this section, we demonstrate how to manually open channels between Karura and Basilisk.
